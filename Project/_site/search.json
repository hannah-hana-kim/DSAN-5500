They are a fundamental concept in the world of computer science and they have the power to help construct a basic CRM system. A linked list consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference link to the next node within a sequence. This structure allows for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations compared to arrays.(“Linked List Data Structure” n.d.)\nBelow is the basic structure of a linked list."
