        "\n",
        "**Preliminary Linked List:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Customer and CustomerLinkedList Classes - Initially, we structured the linked list with a Customer class representing individual customers and a CustomerLinkedList class managing a list of customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Plan Integration - Each customer had a linked list of plans associated with them, allowing for flexibility in managing multiple plans for each customer.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Set and Add Plan Methods - These methods facilitated the setting and addition of plans to customers' linked lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Display Customers and Update Information - Methods were provided for displaying customer information and updating it, although faced with some issues in updating plan information.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Double Linked List:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Introduction of PlanNode - Added to address issues with updating plan information independently of prices, we introduced a PlanNode class to link plans and prices together.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Refinement of Customer Class - The Customer class was updated to store a linked list of PlanNode objects instead of directly storing plan and price attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Updated Methods - Methods for adding customers and displaying customer information remained the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Final Linked List:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Enhanced Plan Addition - Recognizing the need for customers to purchase multiple plans, we implemented the ability to add additional plans and prices to customers' linked lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Dynamic Updates - The code provided showcases how customers' plans can be updated dynamically, allowing for flexibility in managing changing customer preferences.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Visualizing Linked List**\n",
        "\n",
        "- We provided a visualization of the linked list in an attempt to illustrate the structure of this linked list. Although it only includes the customer ID, name, package and prices, it is missing the other information. \n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, each phase of development demonstrates a progressive improvement of our Linked List implementation. We addressed issues with functionality along the way. The final implementation provides a robust solution for managing customers and their plans, with flexibility to accommodate changes and additions over time. \n",
        "\n",
        "We are aware of the drawbacks that come with the usage of linked lists (as highlited in the introduction) and it would be interesting in the future to explore how to implement this CRM linked list structure into a usable software architecture for a startup, like the one we have brainstormed or how to make it faster if the number of customers was to grow.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project provided us with the opportunity to master our proficiency in data structures, specifically linked lists, and think outside the box when it comes to data structures in specific industries. It is beneficial to take a step back from the computer science and bridge the technical work with how it can help a company, and this exploration allowed us to do so.\n",
