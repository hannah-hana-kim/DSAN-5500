	abstract = {The point of departure for this study is the understanding of customer relationship management (CRM) as a set of technological solutions key for efficient business management, the benefits of which, highlighted by previous works, are presented and defined here as crucial for entrepreneurial success. Of particular interest for this purpose are the existing studies on sustainability, which provide a viable research model to assess and validate the potential effect of each CRM component (sales, marketing, and services) on the three dimensions of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social). Upon confirmation of our hypotheses, the subsequent validation of such model should bring a better understanding of the way in which CRM-related benefits may increase the positive impact of its components on each dimension of sustainability. CRM can hence be considered a sort of Green IT, oriented toward digital transformation and sustainable business model innovation. Indeed, this research model may be the basis for a more specific methodology to measure the impact and benefits of applying CRM, understood, as we will contend, both in terms of sustainable business models and innovation.},

	abstract = {Maintaining collaborative relationships of a business firm with the customer is very important in the contemporary competitive business scenario, besides the service rendered by it. Against this backdrop, the study was undertaken which aims to analyse the customer relationship management (CRM) practices and dimensions in the business. The past research studies were reviewed and the CRM frameworks given by the various authors, in particular of Sin, Tse, and Yim (2005, European Journal of Marketing, 11(12), 1264–1290), were critically examined. The research article based on the study revisited the four behavioural dimensions of CRM. A total of 225 respondents were conveniently contacted from banks and hotel establishments. In view of the challenges faced by the business organizations in the contemporary scenario, in particular in the service sector, this article identified and discusses ‘customer prospecting’ and ‘personalization’ as additional practices/dimensions that need to be incorporated to design a robust CRM framework which has been presented as revisited model. Structural equation modeling (SEM) had been used to validate the revisited model. These dimensions, though need to be ratified in the future research.},
